# SearchFile 

## Info

This is a pratise project for familiar with go program.

## Todo

- [x] Search

- [x] Search with goroutine

- [ ] Use args instead of editing program manually

## Idea

- Use a goroutine pool to limit the maximum number of goroutine, every time the program want to make new goroutine, it will send a request to check pool if the amount of current runnning goroutine is more than maximum limit or not. 

- Only if the amount of current running goroutines are not more than maximum, it can make a new goroutine for searching, else it will make recursion.

- Each time the program found target it will pass a boolean value to channel for adding up the count.

- When the for loop done, if the method is the main method of the goroutine, it will send a boolean value to let the goroutine pool know one goroutine is over, and recover the pool.

## Result

In a file tree like below, target is to find all program named "test":

```text
.
├── 13131
│   ├── 34567
│   │   └── test
│   │       ├── 213
│   │       │   └── test
│   │       └── test
│   └── test
│       └── 131313
│           └── 312
│               └── 331
│                   └── test
└── go-test
    └── example
        ├── cmd
        │   └── exm
        │       └── main.go
        ├── go.mod
        └── internal
            ├── exm
            │   └── test
            ├── other
            │   ├── other1.go
            │   └── other2.go
            └── utils
                └── xxx.go

18 directories, 7 files
```

This program will perform result like below:

```text
===Using one thread===
22 matches
During 305.35099ms
===Using multi thread===
22 matches
During 158.611682ms
```
